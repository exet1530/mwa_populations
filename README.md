Analyse the stellar populations of Milky Way Analogues

This project contains the code used to run the analysis and generate the figures for the journal article "Identification of an [α/Fe]—Enhanced Thick Disk Component in an Edge-on Milky Way Analog": https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913L..11S/abstract. 

It is dependent on the astropy and numpy packages, and on the pPXF package of Michele Cappellari (though some elements of this package are replaced by functions in ppxf_muse.py).
